## Information as shown on CurseForge

The *Midnight* is a mod being developed by Cryptic Mushroom that adds a new, mysterious and scary dimension to explore. It is a dimension of darkness; the only light comes from crystals and the various life of the dimension. You may travel willingly to this dimension, though you may unwillingly encounter a rifter and be dragged into this strange and hostile world...

To get to the dimension, you will need to find a rift. These will spawn randomly during the night both above ground and in caves. Though before you go, make sure to be prepared! The Midnight is a hostile place.

We owe a special thanks to ZombieEnderman5 for contributing code to The Midnight, and Terenx for being an awesome tester. They have done an outstanding job with helping us add to and improve the mod!

Midnight was originally an entry for MMD SpookyJam 2018, made over the course of only 2 weeks. In its current state, it is far from complete, and much is still to come!

Anyone has permission to use this mod in their modpack, but be aware that The Midnight is currently in alpha so it is not recommended.
