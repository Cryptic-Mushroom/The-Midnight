# The Midnight

**IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT:** The Midnight is being completely rewritten from the ground up for better stability and performance! More info on the rewrite to come very soon.

*The Midnight* is a mod being developed by Cryptic Mushroom that adds a new, mysterious and scary dimension to explore. It is a dimension of darkness; the only light comes from crystals and the various life of the dimension. You may travel willingly to this dimension, though you may unwillingly encounter a rifter and be dragged into this strange and hostile world...

## Contributions

We are currently not accepting public contributions as we continue to form the basis of the rewrite. If you really want to help contribute to the rewrite of the mod, contact Cipher Zero X, Shadew, or Jonathing.

On the other hand, if you just want to pitch suggestions and ideas our way, feel free to start your own idea thread on our new [GitHub Discussions tab](https://github.com/Cryptic-Mushroom/The-Midnight/discussions)!

## Gradle

For instructions about the new Gradle structure, see [GRADLE.md](GRADLE.md).

## Credits

This mod is a huge collaborative effort with tons of different ideas, coding, and textures pitched in by varying individuals who came together to build something great. We wouldn't be where we are today without the help of those here today and those who worked on this mod in the past. Below is a list of members who participated in the development of The Midnight.

If you are a contributor on this list and want your name to link to a different site, don't hesitate to let anyone on The Midnight Development Team know. You can find us on our discord server.
